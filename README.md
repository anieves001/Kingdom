# Kingdom
Design of an artificial intelligence environment.  There are three types of agents.  Carnivore, Herbivore and Plant.
Carnivores and Herbivores are moveable.  Carnivores eat Herbivores and Herbivores eat Plants.  
If a Carnivore or Herbivore is at a certain range of age or energy then it reproduces.
Plants grow on random times and random places.  Plants, Carnivores and Herbivores die by aging or being eaten.
Herbivores and Carnivores can die by losing energy and not obtaining energy from the environment.
